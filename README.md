# What is the SwitchBot opensource project?
[SwitchBot](https://www.switch-bot.com) is a smart IoT robot to mechanically control all your switches and buttons. You can control the bot by your smartphone app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/SwitchBot/id1087374760?mt=8) or  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theSwitchBot.SwitchBot), SwitchLink, or other platform based on our open APIs.

This project aims to provide a super light-weight solution to control your SwitchBot on [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org)/[OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) or any other Linux based board.

The python-host distribution is supported and tested on Python 2.7.

# How to Install?

## On Raspberry Pi
You will need:
  -  A Raspberry Pi 3 or A Raspberry Pi 2 plugged with a [Bluetooth dongle](https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Bluetooth-Adapter-Raspberry-Compatible/dp/B009ZIILLI/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1487679848&sr=1-3&keywords=bluetooth+dongle).
  -  A SwitchBot.
  -  An SD Card with a fresh install of Raspbian (tested against the latest build [2017-01-11 Jessie with Pixel](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)).

## Installation
  1. Boot your fresh Pi and open a command prompt.
  2. Install the require library.
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-pexpect
sudo apt-get install libusb-dev libdbus-1-dev libglib2.0-dev 
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libical-dev libreadline-dev
sudo pip install bluepy
```
  3. Clone this repo to the Pi.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/python-host.git
cd python-host
```
## Running

You can use in two ways:

1. Scan and control by device name.

```sh
sudo python switchbot.py
```
Follow the instruction, input the device number for SwitchBot you want to control.

2. Control SwitchBot by MAC address. (MAC address should be retrived in advanced)

```sh
sudo python switchbot.py [mac_addr action_cmd]
```

action_cmd :Press, Turn On, Turn Off.

```
eg: sudo python switchbot.py  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx Press
```

## Python 3 and new bluetooth stack support

The original `switchbot.py` script will work only on Python 2 and it relies on the old Bluez utils (like `hciconfig` and `hcitool`) that have been deprecated in the latest Bluez releases.

If you want to use the script on Python 3 or on a Linux distro that no longer ships Bluez with the old tools, use the switchbot_py3.py script instead.

To install the required dependencies on Debian 11 "Bullseye", Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu 21.10 or later:

```sh
sudo apt install python3-bluez
```

On older versions of Ubuntu/Debian/Raspbian:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo apt-get install libbluetooth-dev
pip3 install pybluez
sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-thread-dev
pip3 install gattlib
```

If for some reason the gattlib installation fails:

```sh
sudo apt-get install pkg-config python3-dev
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev

pip3 download gattlib
tar xvzf ./gattlib-0.20150805.tar.gz
cd gattlib-0.20150805/
sed -ie 's/boost_python-py34/boost_python-py36/' setup.py # "py36" might be "py37" (for example). Check "python3 --version"
pip3 install .
```

Type `python3 switchbot_py3.py -h/--help` for usage tips.
```
eg: sudo python3 switchbot_py3.py -d xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -c close
```

Enjoy :)
